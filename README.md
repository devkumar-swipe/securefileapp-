# Secure File System Application

**A Highly Secure File Management System**

Welcome to the Secure File System Application, a project developed as part of a university assignment in collaboration with IBM. This application is designed to provide a secure environment for managing various types of files, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) of your data.

## üöÄ Features

- **CIA Triad Implementation**: The application follows the principles of the CIA triad, ensuring that your data remains confidential, its integrity is preserved, and it is available whenever you need it.
  
- **Cryptography**: Advanced cryptographic techniques are employed to encrypt your files, making this application one of the most secure file systems available.

- **User Authentication with OTP Verification**:
  - **Sign-Up Process**: Users must sign up using their Gmail ID.
  - **OTP Verification**: An OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to the user's Gmail ID for verification. The user must enter the correct OTP to complete the registration process and authenticate their account.

- **Multi-Format File Upload**: Users can upload various types of files, including:
  - Images (JPEG, PNG, etc.)
  - Audio files (MP3, WAV, etc.)
  - Videos (MP4, AVI, etc.)
  - Documents (PDF, DOCX, CSV, etc.)
  - Other files as needed

- **Logout Functionality**: After managing their files, users can securely log out to prevent unauthorized access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS

- **Backend**:
  - PHP

- **Security**:
  - Cryptography
  - User Authentication (Sign-Up, OTP Verification, Login & Logout)

## üéì Project Background

This project was assigned by our university in collaboration with IBM, with a focus on developing a secure and reliable file management system. The goal was to create an application that not only stores files securely but also provides a user-friendly interface for managing them.

## üìÇ How to Use

1. **User Registration**: 
   - Sign up using your Gmail ID.
   - An OTP will be sent to your email. Enter the OTP to verify and complete the registration process.

2. **Login**: After registering, log in with your credentials to access the system.

3. **Upload Files**: Once logged in, you can drag and drop or select files to upload. The application supports a wide range of file formats.

4. **Security**: Your files are encrypted upon upload, ensuring that they are stored securely.

5. **Manage Files**: You can view, download, and manage your files within the application.

6. **Logout**: When done, securely log out to protect your session from unauthorized access.

## üîí Security Features

- **Encryption**: All files are encrypted using robust cryptographic algorithms before they are stored, ensuring data confidentiality.
  
- **Data Integrity**: Checksums and other techniques are used to ensure that your files remain unaltered and intact.
  
- **User Authentication**:
  - **Sign-Up with OTP Verification**: Ensures that only verified users can register and access the system.
  - **Login and Logout**: Controls access to the file management system and secures user sessions.
  
- **Access Control**: Only authenticated users can upload, view, and download files, protecting your data from unauthorized access.

## üìà Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Adding an extra layer of security beyond OTP verification.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Providing different levels of access based on user roles.
- **Audit Logs**: Keeping track of all file uploads, downloads, and modifications for security auditing purposes.
